```
 // Subscribe current game time, if something, then do a triangle function by time
          // else: zero
          // @param: input(current time(t)(ros timestamp into second rather than current game time))
          // @process: utilize t into F(t) (F is the triangle function)
          // return vehicleYawRate into cmd_vel
